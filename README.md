[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)]()

✨ Q-Learning Game An agent acting with the q learning algorithm tries to reach the target by overcoming the obstacles set by the user. .✨
## Project Achievements

- Q-Learning Algorithm
- Dominance of FIFO , LIFO , Linked List data struct structure
- OOP 
- Java Swing

> You can play on a board of any size you want. The rules of the game are as follows:

> The user can put a wall by clicking on the desired squares.

> The user must enter where the agent should start from and where to go.


Please let's not try impossible things :D

## Tech

- Java programing Language
- Java Swing Framework


## Installation
This min requires [Java-8 SDK](https://www.oracle.com/tr/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html)

You must enter the starting and ending points of the agent precisely in terms of the numbers shown on the board but putting a wall is up to you 


    

If you want to change the size of the board:
```sh
    public Board(){
        ....
        this._board_Lines = 10;
        this._board_Cols = 10;
        ...
        
```
You can change this [code](/src/main/Board.java)
